The entire code was written in Microsoft Visual Studio and hence uses MS VC++ 17 as a dependency.
To run the code, follow the given steps:
1. Ensure that you have Microsoft Visual Studio installed on your system. If not, download it from the official site.
2. Open the solution (AI_project.sln) in the codes folder, and run it as debugger.
3. For executable file, look in the folder Demo-x64.
4. Not Recommended: Remove all instances of the header file "stdafx.h", and copy the files AI_project.cpp and game.h into a seperate folder, and compile using g++.
